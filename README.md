# IMDBPyViewer
a program written in Python to generate relational datasets in Prolog format. It uses data from the Internet Movie Database in combination with IMDbPY as backend. A graphical user interface written in pyQt allows the user to link multiple entities together as model for the generation process. The big four entities are Title, Person, Company and Character. Many attributes can be chosen for adding to the output .pl file. Three types of constraints on attributes are available to limit the output: an availability constraint, a range constraint and a value constraint. It works with both MySQL and PostgreSQL as database backend.
